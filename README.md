Project Name - Quiz-App
Github Deployed Page - https://natnaelh14.github.io/quiz-app/

    In this project, I created a quiz app that utilizes local storage to save user's
previous tests. I started with with creating the questions and answers bank. I saved it
in an array of objects. I created an event listener that executes time countdown and 
question generator function. i created a submit button at the end of the quiz to 
to input user's initials so that i can use it as a key for local storage logging.
i posted the local storage data in a separate html that is accessible from index.html.
I styled the application using Flexbox and google fonts. As a challenge, I made sure
the selected answer button turned red, when it is wrong and turned green, when it is right.
Thanks.
